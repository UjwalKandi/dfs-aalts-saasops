# Agentic AI Log Troubleshooting System (AALTS)

## Overview

The **Agentic AI Log Troubleshooting System (AALTS)** is an AI-driven solution designed to enhance the observability and troubleshooting capabilities of edge devices in distributed environments. AALTS automates the initial analysis of logs generated by these devices, offering rapid insights into potential issues before the support or development teams intervene.

### Key Features
- **Automated Log Analysis:** Uses AI to perform basic troubleshooting on logs, identifying anomalies in metrics such as response codes, response times, and data throughput.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Comprises specialized agents that handle different tasks, including log data management, semantic search, and query processing.
- **Edge Device Compatibility:** Optimized to run locally on edge devices with minimal compute, storage, and bandwidth requirements.
- **Offline Functionality:** Designed to operate in low or no internet environments, ensuring consistent performance even in remote locations.
